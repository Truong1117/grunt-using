# Installing and configuring Grunt
Magento has built-in Grunt tasks configured, but there are still several steps you need to take to be able to use it:

1. Install node.js to any location on your machine.

2. Install Grunt CLI tool globally. To do this, run the following command in a command prompt:
  $ npm install -g grunt-cli
  
3. From the <Magento_root> directory, copy and paste the contents of the following files:
  $ package.json.sample into package.json
  $ Gruntfile.js.sample into Gruntfile.js
  $ grunt-config.json.sample into grunt-config.json
  
4. Install (or refresh) the node.js project dependency, including Grunt, for your Magento instance. To do this, run the following commands in a command prompt:
  $ cd your_Magento_instance_directory
  $ npm install
  $ npm update
  
5. (Optional) If you want to use Grunt for “watching” changes automatically, without reloading pages in a browser each time, install the LiveReload extension in your browser.

# Grunt configuration file
Copy the contents of themes.js into local-themes.js in the dev/tools/grunt/configs/ directory.

If installed as described above, Grunt will use the default configuration files located in the dev/tools/grunt/configs/ directory. You can define your theme in the local-themes.js file. The following shows an example of how you can define your theme.

<theme>: {
  area: '<area>',
  name: '<Vendor>/<theme>,
  locale: '<language>',
  files: [
    '<path_to_file1>', //path to root source file
    '<path_to_file2>'
  ],
dsl: 'less'
}

# Using custom Grunt configuration files

1. grunt clean: 	Removes the theme related static files in the pub/static and var directories.
2. grunt exec:<theme> - grunt exec	Republishes symlinks to the source files to the pub/static/frontend/ directory. Use grunt exec:<theme> to republish symlinks for a specific theme.
3. grunt less:<theme> - grunt less	Compiles CSS files using the symlinks published in the pub/static/frontend/ directory. Use grunt less:<theme> to use the symlinks published for a specific theme.
4. grunt watch - Tracks the changes in the source files, recompiles .css files, and reloads the page in the browser.
